# Definition: git-status

The git-status command allows the user to view the working directory and the staging area in the terminal. This command will show which files are:
1. Staged
2. Unstaged
3. Untracked

It is a command that can help programmers see what's happening in a directory directly from the terminal and see the status of changes before commiting them. 

You can use thsi command similarly in the JupyterIDE by running shell commands, like !git status. I have a personal prefrence of using VCS as my editor of choice.
